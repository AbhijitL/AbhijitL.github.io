## Hello Jekyll!!

Before switching to jekyll i used Gridsome which is a static site generator using Vue.js.


But this was abandoned few years ago and maitaining the project was tiring and not cool for me,
And I always wanted to make a new site without using unnecessary npm packages which was causing 
too many dependency errors and vulnerability.
