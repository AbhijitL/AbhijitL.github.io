    - name: Nier Automata hacking arcade fan made
      description: A fan made game in CryEngine, I am trying to recreate the hacking arcade mode from Nier Automata. Currently making this project with almost no resource as documentation is down and i have to use wayback machine. Due to this i need to dive down in CryEngine Source code to understand how it works.

    - name: Slime Stomper
      description: A game where you need to stomps those slimes before they stomps you. I made this project in Godot Engine for a 48 hour game jam. This was a fun game to make and i learned quite a lot while making this game. I use state machines for the player movement and enemy behaviour from scratch.
