## Demo
A demo of this site is available here: [https://gridsome-neumorphic-starter.netlify.app](https://gridsome-neumorphic-starter.netlify.app)

## Install
### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have
`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project
1. Navigation in your Terminal app to the folder you'd like to install your project. 
2. `gridsome create my-site-name https://github.com/bradsiefert/gridsome-neumorphic-starter` to install this starter project
3. `cd my-site-name` to move to the folder
4. `gridsome develop` to start a local Gridsome development server at `http://localhost:8080`
5. Get to coding! You can do it! ðŸ™ŒðŸŽ‰

### 3. Starter Features
- Uses `Bootstrap v5.0.0alpha1`. I wanted to test out v5, and I didn't have any issues in using it. You should likely update to later versions as they become available. 
- Uses SCSS
- Uses the `@gridsome/plugin-filesystem` to import data into the site
- Users the `@gridsome/plugin-sitemap` to create a sitemap on build
- My markdown files use the same front-matter as [DEV.to](https://dev.to) in case you want to cross post
- The contact form is all setup and ready to use for Netlify forms
- This site is based on my [personal site](https://bradsiefert.com). I figured I should share it with the wonderful Gridsome community.
