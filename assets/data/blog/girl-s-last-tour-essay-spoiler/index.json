They were told by their grandpa to go to the highest level of the city as there was no hope left and set them off on a journey on a reliable bike/tank hybrid vehicle mainly used for transportation of goods in a war zone.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/reasonstoanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kettenkrad.jpg?resize=874%2C498&ssl=1\">\n<p>\n<p>The world where they are living right now is a vast empty abandoned towering city made up of multiple layers stacked on top of another which were built by the long-lost civilization of humanity which knowledge and technology are forgotten by current humanity.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://animesolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Shoujo-Shuumatsu-Ryokou_12.03_2017.10.20_10.34.34_stitch.jpg\">\n<p>\n<p>A few years have passed since they left their grandpa. The two’s main objective was to find resources scattered throughout this world city and go toward a higher level of the city. Yuuri is a laidback and almost carefree attitude while Chito is calm and composed but can get angry at Yuuri on occasions. Chito drives and maintains the vehicle she does all of the work which requires planning and decision making while Yuuri does the work which requires physical. While traveling throughout this vast city they haven’t seen anything that can be called living beings heck they have never seen any living beings in their lives other than the few humans back in the settlement who may have long lost gone. They lived on rations that they salvaged from storage which was rare to find throughout these barren concrete buildings.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/90rye3VMmHY/maxresdefault.jpg\">\n<p>\n<p>While on one of their aimless journey they stumble upon what might have once been a war zone. Guns and military vehicles lay wasted upon the rubble. There was no shortage of weapons to be found on the ground while food on the other hand was scarce. Luckily they found some explosives and rations inside a decaying aircraft. The food will help for a few weeks. Yuuri mentions if people just focused on making food instead of weapons they would have been better off. Since they have been scavenging for hours they finally rest and ate the ration they found. Yuuri and Chito were surprised they have never tasted anything like this before, Yurri looks at the ration package and said “choco flavored bar” they don’t know what it is and never heard of it. While munching those bars Chitto asked why they were fighting, Yuuri answered probably due to low resources.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"http://www.imfdb.org/images/b/b7/Shoujo_Shuumatsu_Ryokou_tank_1_4.jpg\">\n<p>\n<p>Along the way, the story sets for the girls a series of encounters all focused on ideas of purpose happiness, and what keeps people going. The girls are kept going in the hope if they reach the top most level there will be other people waiting for them. Chito writes her daily event in a journal so that if she dies or something else happens at least there’s a possibility of her struggles living on without her while Yuuri is the opposite not caring too much and enjoying her in-the-moment experiences but they still get along really well and care about each other. On one of their journey, the girls thought of doing laundry in a stream of water created by the melting snow. They came across this mysterious thing which was flowing through the water, later they found it was once called fish by people from the past. They have never seen nor eaten fish in their lives only heard or read about them in books. They roast the fish for dinner which was surprisingly good for them as it was their fast time eating a fish.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MpepEwv.png\">\n<p>\n<p> While searching for the fish source they meet the first human character in the story a man obsessed with map-making, he has plotted many layers of the city, he is all alone but despite that, he fills his life with map-making. With his maps as a guide, he hitched a ride with the girls helping them to find resources for them. While on the way to the upper level of the city a hiccup in the elevator made his pages of maps spill out blowing in the wind, he’s defeated and decides not to continue with the girls, and one of the things he still has is his camera which he gives to the girls and leaves them forever.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NED3rcQ.png\">\n<p>\n<p>As their journey continues, the vehicle broke down. Chito inspects the vehicle to see if she can fix it or not while Yuuri lay down on a boulder and sang “it’s hopeless” cheerfully which irritated Chito. The girls noticed someone on the horizon which lead to the next human they met, The human is a woman who is really good with technology and is trying to build herself a working plane so that she can fly out to a destination, she thinks that if she flies far enough she can leave the place and maybe find new people. The girls help her out in return she repairs their vehicle. After some time they eventually finally complete the plane which she takes off into the sky and it malfunctions causing her emergency ejection and parachute as she falls down to the lower level of the city, it may take probably years to make the plane from scratch again as if she manages to feed herself and make it back at all.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://daladybug.productions/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/vlcsnap-2018-01-12-19h39m46s181.png\">\n<p>\n<p>As the girls journey continues they stumble upon an old factory, they came across a robot that is made to take care of aquariums still functioning, this robot is caring for the only one living fish left on the earth. Yuuri wants to immediately eat it but the robot pleads with them not to do this.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.anisearch.com/images/anime/screen/12/12597/full/386705.webp\">\n<p>\n<p>Even tho if they eat the fish nothing will happen or nothing can be done as it can’t be reproduced as it’s the last fish on the earth. The robot was kind and helpful it even suggested sleeping near the pipes as it is warm and hot. Chito asked the robot “are you alive?”, the robot said, “No, I am programmed to be compassionate towards humans”.While they were in the factory another robot that was maintaining the place decided to break down the aquarium the fish was living in for using the resource on another critical part of the factory. Yuuri decided to help the aquarium fish caretake robot and help destroy the other construction robot so that it may help the aquarium robot to take care of the fish for a few more years. Which made Chito speaks, “Maybe life is what that has an end”.\nOn their journey toward the higher level of the city, they encountered a lot of things, still working factory on the verge of a breakdown, the last remaining part of the world city where the electricity is still working, a mass graveyard of the long lost people, the recorded lives of many people from the past and many more. The girls had reached the third level of the city, in which they encounter an AI. The AI seems to have some sense of sentience. The AI can move endlessly, it is not bound by any sort of form almost like a ghost, and goes on telling how happy they are to finally have someone to talk to. The AI has been spending their endless lives writing poems for countless years. The AI helps them and offers to move them up into the next layer. They ask the girls in return to give them one thing. The AI asks if the girls will kill them.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://mynameismitchell.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ai-death2.jpg\">\n<p>\n<p>As their journey has almost reached the final destination, the girls encounter a building that they inspect in order to look for rations, the place seems to be some sort of rocket launching station. There were lots of documents indicating a few groups of humans had left the planet earth on some big rocket.</p>\n<p>They have finally reached the place which leads to the last final level of the city. They continue to go upwards which took days, on their way they left almost all of their belonging as it was of no use to them their vehicle breakdown required them to leave.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://mynameismitchell.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/kettenkrad1_waifu2x_art_scale_tta_1.png?w=768&h=1135\">\n<p>\n<p>They burned the journals, and books they have collected in order to keep them warm as it was meaningless now. They finally reached the final destination which was just a vast empty field of nothingness. The girls were happy that they reached the place their grandpa told them to. Chiito asked Yuuri if they have taken another way, what will be the scenario. As the girls take the last remaining rations and slept on the rubbles their journey ended as the snowfall covered them inch by inch.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://mynameismitchell.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img00018gca.png\">\n<p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cLFxxsf.jpeg\">\n<p>\n<p>The End.</p>\n<p><code>Please watch the series or read the manga.This is not complete and I haven't written lots of important points, memoriable journeys and encounters here</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"about-the-anime-and-manga\"><a href=\"#about-the-anime-and-manga\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>About the anime and manga.</h2>\n<p>Trailer</p>\n<div class=\"videoWrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lzw364Q-Edo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
