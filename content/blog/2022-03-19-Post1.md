## Review

What is the definition of a masterpiece?. How do we know a piece of work whether it is a beautifully crafted object, words, scientific paper, art, literature, and the never-ending things?.We have rated many things masterpiece without properly knowing what a masterpiece actually is.

This movie in my opinion marks the definition of a masterpiece. One of the best things I have ever felt in my life, the emotions that I usually ignored came ... . I learned the meaning of those feeling which I thought I know to the fullest.

Thank you KyoAni for producing this masterpiece and making me enjoy your work.
